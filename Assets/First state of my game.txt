Festers. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.
At least 01 of them guarding the hangar door. Typical.

Culd try punching my way through. Or sneaking the long way to the emergency exit.

What should Ido?
1. Take them head on - rush the 10 guards;
2. Sneak my way to the emergency exit.
